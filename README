Custom Segmented Control
by Tim Poulsen (skypanther)

This is a sample Appcelerator Titanium Mobile project containing a factory method for creating a segmented control that will work on both Android and iPhone.

See app.js for the code.

It's based on the structure of the Tweetanium project. If you're not using that sort of modular framework, you might have to do some work pulling out the parts you need.

Factory function is:
sc.makeTabbedBar(params, fn)

where params is a map of element properties, such as {labels:['One','Two'], top:100, foo:'bar'}
fn is the callback function to execute when one of the buttons is clicked

The function returns the index of the clicked button

The code is released under the MIT License so you're free to use it in commercial and open source projects.
