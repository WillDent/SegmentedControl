Cross-platform segmented control (TabbedBar)
by @skypanther

Appcelerator Titanium CommonJS module to create a segmented control ("radio button set") for iOS and Android

Requires Ti SDK 1.8+ (or modify makeTabbedBar to use Ti.UI.createTabbedBar instead of Ti.UI.iOS.createTabbedBar)

Usage:
var tbar = require('/path/custTabBar').makeTabbedBar({paramObj}, _fn);

Params: 
	{paramObj} is map of properties to match those defined by Ti.UI.iOS.TabbedBar, see DEFAULTS below for list of params that can be set on Android (all the native props are supported on iOS)
	_fn is a is a function to be called when a button on the tabbed bar is clicked, it will be passed the index of the button clicked 

iOS: returns an instance of Ti.UI.iOS.TabbedBar
Android: returns custom UI control to mimic TabbedBar

See app.js for sample implementation.

Two images are used for backgrounds on Android. See images folder. 

The code is cross-released under the MIT/Apache/GPL3 licenses so you're free to use it in commercial and open source projects.
